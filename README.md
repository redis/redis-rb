A Ruby client library for [Redis][redis-home].

[redis-home]: http://redis.io

A Ruby client that tries to match Redis' API one-to-one, while still
providing an idiomatic interface. It features thread-safety, client-side
sharding, pipelining, and an obsession for performance.

## Upgrading from 2.x to 3.0

Please refer to the [CHANGELOG][changelog-3.0.0] for a summary of the
most important changes, as well as a full list of changes.

[changelog-3.0.0]: https://github.com/redis/redis-rb/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#300

## Getting started

As of version 2.0 this client only targets Redis version 2.0 and higher.
You can use an older version of this client if you need to interface
with a Redis instance older than 2.0, but this is no longer supported.

You can connect to Redis by instantiating the `Redis` class:

```ruby
require "redis"

redis = Redis.new
```

This assumes Redis was started with a default configuration, and it
listening on `localhost`, port 6379. If you need to connect to a remote
server or a different port, try:

```ruby
redis = Redis.new(:host => "10.0.1.1", :port => 6380)
```

To connect to Redis listening on a Unix socket, try:

```ruby
redis = Redis.new(:path => "/tmp/redis.sock")
```

The Redis class exports methods that are named identical to the commands
they execute. The arguments these methods accept are often identical to
the arguments specified on the [Redis website][redis-commands]. For
instance, the `SET` and `GET` commands can be called like this:

[redis-commands]: http://redis.io/commands

```ruby
redis.set("mykey", "hello world")
# => "OK"

redis.get("mykey")
# => "hello world"
```

All commands, their arguments and return values are documented, and
available on [rdoc.info][rdoc].

## Storing objects

Redis only stores strings as values. If you want to store an object, you
can use a serialization mechanism such as JSON:

```ruby
require "json"

redis.set "foo", [1, 2, 3].to_json
# => OK

JSON.parse(redis.get("foo"))
# => [1, 2, 3]
```

## Pipelining

When multiple commands are executed sequentially, but are not dependent,
the calls can be *pipelined*. This means that the client doesn't wait
for reply of the first command before sending the next command. The
advantage is that multiple commands are sent at once, resulting in
faster overall execution.

The client can be instructed to pipeline commands by using the
`#pipelined` method. After the block is executed, the client sends all
commands to Redis and gathers their replies. These replies are returned
by the `#pipelined` method.

```ruby
redis.pipelined do
  redis.set "foo", "bar"
  redis.incr "baz"
end
# => ["OK", 1]
```

### Executing commands atomically

You can use `MULTI/EXEC` to run a number of commands in an atomic
fashion. This is similar to executing a pipeline, but the commands are
preceded by a call to `MULTI`, and followed by a call to `EXEC`. Like
the regular pipeline, the replies to the commands are returned by the
`#multi` method.

```ruby
redis.multi do
  redis.set "foo", "bar"
  redis.incr "baz"
end
# => ["OK", 1]
```

### Futures

Replies to commands in a pipeline can be accessed via the *futures* they
emit (since redis-rb 3.0). All calls inside a pipeline block return a
`Future` object, which responds to the `#value` method. When the
pipeline has succesfully executed, all futures are assigned their
respective replies and can be used.

```ruby
redis.pipelined do
  @set = redis.set "foo", "bar"
  @incr = redis.incr "baz"
end

@set.value
# => "OK"

@incr.value
# => 1
```

## Alternate drivers

By default, redis-rb uses Ruby's socket library to talk with Redis.
To use an alternative connection driver it should be specified as option
when instantiating the client object. These instructions are only valid
for **redis-rb 3.0**. For instructions on how to use alternate drivers from
**redis-rb 2.2**, please refer to an [older README][readme-2.2.2].

[readme-2.2.2]: https://github.com/redis/redis-rb/blob/v2.2.2/README.md

### hiredis

The hiredis driver uses the connection facility of hiredis-rb. In turn,
hiredis-rb is a binding to the official hiredis client library. It
optimizes for speed, at the cost of portability. Because it is a C
extension, JRuby is not supported (by default).

It is best to use hiredis when you have large replies (for example:
`LRANGE`, `SMEMBERS`, `ZRANGE`, etc.) and/or use big pipelines.

In your Gemfile, include hiredis:

```ruby
gem "redis", "~> 3.0.0.rc2"
gem "hiredis", "~> 0.4.5"
```

When instantiating the client object, specify hiredis:

```ruby
redis = Redis.new(:driver => :hiredis)
```

### synchrony

The synchrony driver adds support for [em-synchrony][em-synchrony].
This makes redis-rb work with EventMachine's asynchronous I/O, while not
changing the exposed API. The hiredis gem needs to be available as
well, because the synchrony driver uses hiredis for parsing the Redis
protocol.

[em-synchrony]: https://github.com/igrigorik/em-synchrony

In your Gemfile, include em-synchrony and hiredis:

```ruby
gem "redis", "~> 3.0.0.rc2"
gem "hiredis", "~> 0.4.5"
gem "em-synchrony"
```

When instantiating the client object, specify synchrony:

```ruby
redis = Redis.new(:driver => :synchrony)
```

## Testing

This library is tested using [Travis][travis-home], where it is tested
against the following interpreters and drivers:

* MRI 1.8.7 (drivers: ruby, hiredis)
* MRI 1.9.2 (drivers: ruby, hiredis, synchrony)
* MRI 1.9.3 (drivers: ruby, hiredis, synchrony)
* JRuby 1.6 (1.8 mode) (drivers: ruby)
* JRuby 1.6 (1.9 mode) (drivers: ruby)
