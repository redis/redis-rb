# This example creates a master-slave setup with a sentinel, then connects to
# it and sends write commands in a loop.
#
# After 30 seconds, the master dies. You will be able to see how a new master
# is elected and things continue to work as if nothing happened.
#
# To run this example:
#
#   $ ruby -I./lib examples/sentinel.rb
#

    Process.kill(:INT, $redises)

r = Redis.new(:url => "redis://master1", :sentinels => Sentinels, :role => :master)

# Set keys into a loop.
#
# The example traps errors so that you can actually try to failover while
# running the script to see redis-rb reconfiguring.
