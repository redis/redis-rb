# This file implements a simple consistency test for Redis-rb (or any other
# Redis environment if you pass a different client object) where a client
# writes to the database using INCR in order to increment keys, but actively
# remember the value the key should have. Before every write a read is performed
# to check if the value in the database matches the value expected.
#
# In this way this program can check for lost writes, or acknowledged writes
# that were executed.
